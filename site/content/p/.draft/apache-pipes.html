Initial commit for my personal website. This post marks my first serious commital to maintaining a blog, one that's maintained using the Git SCM.

Still working out the kinks in my new site, but am thus far really pleased with how its turning out. This site, including the blog section, is powered by the [Hyde](http://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde) static website generator.
